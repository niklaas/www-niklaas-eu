Mounting external drives in Windows Subsystem for Linux is quite simple. That
said I always forget how to do so. Here's a short reminder:

<!-- more -->

```{shell}
$ mount -t drvfs f: /mnt/f
```

where `f:` denotes the device letter as known by Windows.

In a similar manner it is also possible to mount network shares:

```{shell}
$ mount -t drvfs '\\servername\share' /mnt/share
```
