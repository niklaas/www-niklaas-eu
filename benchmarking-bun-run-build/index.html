    <div class="post-content">
      <p>When writing small tools that support me with my daily work, I usually opted to shell-scripting with <code>sh</code>, <code>bash</code> or 
even <code>zsh</code> because I find the concept of piping text from one command to another pretty appealing. It's a 
straightforward and powerful concept that doesn't require a lot of set up: most CLI tools operate on a per-line 
basis, so it's a bliss to combine them.</p>
<p>The situation becomes more challenging when I need to work on JSONs, which are more natural in the JavaScript world, 
where I often work in. Usually, I opted for <code>jq</code> to parse JSON into line-based data, but I keep forgetting its 
syntax, which also can turn out complex and difficult to read.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>So far, the intricacies of getting JavaScript code that is meant for the browser to run using node.js on the command 
line, kept me from actually considering this option. Usually, I would run into issues because the code I want to 
reuse for a quick command-line session used browser APIs that don't work in node.js.</p>
<p>When I learned about <a href="https://bun.sh">bun.js</a>, claiming that it makes running JavaScript code <em>just work</em> on the 
command-line, I got very interested. And it turns out it holds its promises---at least for the specific use case that I
had some days ago. I had implemented a function that provides a suggestion for a misspelled email domain and wanted to
run it with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/">GNU parallel</a> on a bunch of misspelled domains. (Using GNU parallel
saved me from dealing with JavaScript's single-threaded-ness and <code>async/await</code>s.)</p>
<p>I ended up writing a short JavaScript file that takes in a single parameter and calls my function with the parameter 
as an argument. Then, I was able to run <code>bun run my-script.js</code> and it took care of different styles of imports, 
<code>node_modules</code> and whatever would have caused my headaches using <code>nodejs</code> for executing the file. ðŸŽ‰</p>
<p>Since <code>bun run</code> would reparse the file on every call, I decided to use <code>bun build</code> to compile the script to a binary.
I continued running the binary in parallel, this time avoiding the unnecessary reparsing. Creating a binary from a 
JavaScript turned out to be straightforward as well using <code>bun build</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>bun build my-script.js --compile --outfile my-script
</span></code></pre>
<p>Before running the binary in parallel, I wanted to know whether, as I had anticipated, the compiled version would 
run faster than calling <code>bun run</code> again and again. As it turned out, that day I would make yet another discovery 
that would make this quest pretty easy to solve: <code>hyperfine</code> for command line benchmarking:</p>
<pre data-lang="shell" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-shell "><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell"><span>hyperfine --warmup 5 &#39;bun run my-script-cli.js&#39; &#39;./my-script-cli&#39;
</span></code></pre>
<pre data-lang="text" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span>Benchmark 1: bun run my-script-cli.js
</span><span>  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      32.6 ms Â±   0.6 ms    [User: 47.7 ms, System: 20.3 ms]
</span><span>  Range (min â€¦ max):    31.1 ms â€¦  33.8 ms    84 runs
</span><span>
</span><span>Benchmark 2: ./my-script-cli
</span><span>  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      15.2 ms Â±   0.6 ms    [User: 15.5 ms, System: 4.4 ms]
</span><span>  Range (min â€¦ max):    14.2 ms â€¦  18.6 ms    168 runs
</span><span>
</span><span>Summary
</span><span>  ./my-script-cli ran
</span><span>    2.14 Â± 0.10 times faster than bun run suggest-domain-cli.js
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the end, with the new tooling that I had found, it was straightforward for me to convert existing business logic 
that was ingrained in a frontend project to a command line utility. In addition to that, some more keystrokes later, 
I had performed a basic benchmark of that utility too!</p>
