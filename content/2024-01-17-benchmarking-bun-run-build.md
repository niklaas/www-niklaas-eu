When writing small tools that support me with my daily work, I usually opted to shell-scripting with `sh`, `bash` or 
even `zsh` because I find the concept of piping text from one command to another pretty appealing. It's a 
straightforward and powerful concept that doesn't require a lot of set up: most CLI tools operate on a per-line 
basis, so it's a bliss to combine them.

The situation becomes more challenging when I need to work on JSONs, which are more natural in the JavaScript world, 
where I often work in. Usually, I opted for `jq` to parse JSON into line-based data, but I keep forgetting its 
syntax, which also can turn out complex and difficult to read.

So far, the intricacies of getting JavaScript code that is meant for the browser to run using node.js on the command 
line, kept me from actually considering this option. Usually, I would run into issues because the code I want to 
reuse for a quick command-line session used browser APIs that don't work in node.js.

When I learned about [bun.js](https://bun.sh), claiming that it makes running JavaScript code _just work_ on the 
command-line, I got very interested. And it turns out it holds its promises---at least for the specific use case that I
had some days ago. I had implemented a function that provides a suggestion for a misspelled email domain and wanted to
run it with [GNU parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) on a bunch of misspelled domains. (Using GNU parallel
saved me from dealing with JavaScript's single-threaded-ness and `async/await`s.)

I ended up writing a short JavaScript file that takes in a single parameter and calls my function with the parameter 
as an argument. Then, I was able to run `bun run my-script.js` and it took care of different styles of imports, 
`node_modules` and whatever would have caused my headaches using `nodejs` for executing the file. ðŸŽ‰

Since `bun run` would reparse the file on every call, I decided to use `bun build` to compile the script to a binary.
I continued running the binary in parallel, this time avoiding the unnecessary reparsing. Creating a binary from a 
JavaScript turned out to be straightforward as well using `bun build`:

```shell
bun build my-script.js --compile --outfile my-script
```

Before running the binary in parallel, I wanted to know whether, as I had anticipated, the compiled version would 
run faster than calling `bun run` again and again. As it turned out, that day I would make yet another discovery 
that would make this quest pretty easy to solve: `hyperfine` for command line benchmarking:

```shell
hyperfine --warmup 5 'bun run my-script-cli.js' './my-script-cli'
```

```text
Benchmark 1: bun run my-script-cli.js
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      32.6 ms Â±   0.6 ms    [User: 47.7 ms, System: 20.3 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):    31.1 ms â€¦  33.8 ms    84 runs

Benchmark 2: ./my-script-cli
  Time (mean Â± Ïƒ):      15.2 ms Â±   0.6 ms    [User: 15.5 ms, System: 4.4 ms]
  Range (min â€¦ max):    14.2 ms â€¦  18.6 ms    168 runs

Summary
  ./my-script-cli ran
    2.14 Â± 0.10 times faster than bun run suggest-domain-cli.js
```

In the end, with the new tooling that I had found, it was straightforward for me to convert existing business logic 
that was ingrained in a frontend project to a command line utility. In addition to that, some more keystrokes later, 
I had performed a basic benchmark of that utility too!
