It's a \nstraightforward and powerful concept that doesn't require a lot of set up: most CLI tools operate on a per-line \nbasis, so it's a bliss to combine them.\nThe situation becomes more challenging when I need to work on JSONs, which are more natural in the JavaScript world, \nwhere I often work in. Usually, I opted for jq to parse JSON into line-based data, but I keep forgetting its \nsyntax, which also can turn out complex and difficult to read.\n\nSo far, the intricacies of getting JavaScript code that is meant for the browser to run using node.js on the command \nline, kept me from actually considering this option. Usually, I would run into issues because the code I want to \nreuse for a quick command-line session used browser APIs that don't work in node.js.\nWhen I learned about bun.js, claiming that it makes running JavaScript code just work on the \ncommand-line, I got very interested. And it turns out it holds its promises---at least for the specific use case that I\nhad some days ago. I had implemented a function that provides a suggestion for a misspelled email domain and wanted to\nrun it with GNU parallel on a bunch of misspelled domains. (Using GNU parallel\nsaved me from dealing with JavaScript's single-threaded-ness and async/awaits.)\nI ended up writing a short JavaScript file that takes in a single parameter and calls my function with the parameter \nas an argument. Then, I was able to run bun run my-script.js and it took care of different styles of imports, \nnode_modules and whatever would have caused my headaches using nodejs for executing the file. 🎉\nSince bun run would reparse the file on every call, I decided to use bun build to compile the script to a binary.\nI continued running the binary in parallel, this time avoiding the unnecessary reparsing. Creating a binary from a \nJavaScript turned out to be straightforward as well using bun build:\n\nBefore running the binary in parallel, I wanted to know whether, as I had anticipated, the compiled version would \nrun faster than calling bun run again and again. As it turned out, that day I would make yet another discovery \nthat would make this quest pretty easy to solve: hyperfine for command line benchmarking:\n\n\nIn the end, with the new tooling that I had found, it was straightforward for me to convert existing business logic \nthat was ingrained in a frontend project to a command line utility.

I must revise that advice because of two\nreasons:\n\n\nIt seems Nullmailer does not allow changing the sender of sent mails.\nProviding credentials in /etc/nullmailer/remotes is a security flaw because\nthey can be caught by any user running ps aux.\n\nHowever, changing the sender is important. While installing nullmailer on a\nlocal system over the weekend, I again got struck by the fact that\nPosteo would not allow relaying mail from a host that does not have a\nfully-qualified domain name -- obviously my local Raspberry Pi does not have\none.\nThe solution is to change the sender. Instead of sending mail with a sender like\ne.g., root@rpi-local, masquerade the sender with an envelope-from. In our case\nwe can use the Posteo account.\nThat said, it seems nullmailer cannot do so, see this StackExchange\npost. In the same post they also talk about the above\nmentioned security flaw.

However, if you don't set it up\ncorrectly, you won't receive important information about the health of the\nsystems you administer.\nOn systems that are only used by a single user, you don't need a full-fledged\nmail transfer agent (MTA)1 to receive system mail. You want every mail to\nbe delivered to a single user i.e., the email address you regularly check. This\nis when nullmailer shines.\nOnce you replace the default MTA of your system with nullmailer, you can set it\nup to forward every mail to a single email address. This is quite handy because\nthen you can make sure that you will receive important information about your\nservers e.g., unattended upgrades, failed cron jobs and the like.\nIn the following I describe how to configure nullmailer on Debian. After having\nit installed with sudo apt install nullmailer, we need to check three\nconfiguration files:\n\n/etc/nullmailer/adminaddr: the address all system mail should be relayed to\n/etc/nullmailer/defaultdomain: appended to all hostnames that aren't fully\nqualified\n/etc/nullmailer/remotes: contains the mail relays where all system should be\nrelayed through\n\nIt makes sense to relay mail through a server / an account that you can trust.\nOf course, you can relay mail through your own systems. However, what will you\ndo, if these systems strike too? It makes sense to use a third party service\nthat provides the required security (sensitive information might be relayed!).\nHow will we use such a service? On the one hand we will use an extern email\naccount to send system mail. On the other hand we will use the very same account\nto receive the mail we sent. This sounds a bit weird in the first place but\nmakes totally sense once you realise that this makes for a very easy setup.\nIt's not easy to find a secure email provider that you can trust. I decided to\nuse Posteo because it provides a lot of security\nfeatures that other\nproviders lack. It only costs 1 Euro per month which makes it very cheap too.\n(Disclaimer: I am not affiliated to Posteo.)\nOnce you registered an external account, nullmailer requires the login settings\nof the account. In the following example I use STARTTLS for a secure connection\nand configure nullmailer to use the appropriate port and username/password\ncombination. mail.example.com is the SMTP server while smtp specifies the\nchosen protocol.\n\nSince you probably administer multiple systems, it makes sense to filter the\nmail you receive on the external account into subfolders. This can be achieved\nquite easily by so-called recipient delimiters, the plus sign + being a quite\nprominent one.2 The following is a general example.\n\nRecipient delimiters also work for Google Mail addresses such as\njohn+important@gmail.com. Although an additional tag important was provided,\njohn@gmail.com would receive the message. However, John could easily filter\nthe message because of the provided tag.\nI recommend to transfer this idea to our example, use the hostname of the system\nas a unique tag, and filter the received mail on the external account accordingly.\nFor system mail that doesn't provide a fully qualified domain e.g., mail sent to\nroot@localhost you should provide the default domain in file defaultdomain.\n\nYou can test if everything works by using the sendmail command provided by nullmailer:\n\nCheck your external email account. You should have received a message containing\nthe text \"test\".\n1\nI highly recommend reading the Wikipedia post on mail infrastructure to get a better understanding on how it works.\n\n2\nTo get a better understanding of what a recipient delimiter is, take a look a the Postfix configuration page.

For me it is more than a convenient way of\nconcatenating tasks, prettifying and/or reducing the amount of code.\nI intrinsically connect it to the first two principles of the UNIX\nphilosophy:1\n\n\nWrite programs that do one thing and do it well.\nWrite programs to work together.\n\nThe philosophy tells us that, by focusing on smaller functions (or programs)\naddressing smaller problems, it is easier to find a solution to bigger\nproblems; and, as an extra, we can simply reuse our \"small\" solutions in other\ncircumstances to tackle other problems.2 A pipe operator\neases running smaller functions one after the other by passing the output of\nthe first function to the second to the third and so on. That is, the operator\ncan serve as (the missing) link between your functions to quickly -- but\ncomprehensibly -- solve a problem. Its mere existence makes following the UNIX\nphilosophy attractive and serves as great motivation to pursue it.\nOn UNIX shells, such as sh or bash, the pipe operator is | and one of the\nmost fundamental tools for everyone who works on the command line. For example,\nto find all R files underneath your local R library that include R's pipe\noperator execute the following:3\n\nIn this case, the pipe operator helps us to combine the power of find,\nxargs and grep. In fact, these are independent programs but their\ndevelopers have done there best to ensure that they work together. We can\ncombine them in an arbitrary manner to solve problems nobody has thought of\nbefore, such as finding all R files underneath our local R library that include\nR's pipe operator %&gt;%.\nR's pipe operator is not part of base::. But by shipping it with the\nmagrittr package,4 it has become a fundamental part of the\ntidyverse. The pipe reveals its power especially\nin conjunction with dplyr (and\ntidyr) -- but let's start small. What is it for\nexactly?\nLet's say you have two functions f1 and f2, and some data x. If you were\nto apply the first and the second function to x one after the other you would\nprobably do something like the following:\n\nOr, something like this:\n\nUsing the pipe operator %&gt;% you can simplify the code:\n\nIn this case, imagine x as a stream of data that flows through f1 and f2\nfollowing the direction %&gt;% points to. Each time it reaches a function, the\nfunction is applied to the data, and passed further on along the stream. Once\nit reaches the end of the line, the result is stored in y. This way,\nreasoning about the code is much easier.\nTake a more complex example with some example data from iris.  Let's say you\nwant to inspect species setosa and calculate the mean of Sepal.Length.\nTraditionally, you would do something like the following:\n\nWith the pipe operator you can simplify the task by combining dplyr's filter\nand summarize functions.\n\n\nOnce again, we can imagine a data stream that flows through filter and\nsummarize. Each time it reaches a function, the function is applied to the\nstream. At the end the final output is printed. (In this example, you could\nomit the call to unlist at the end. It only serves the purpose to make the\noutput look like the one of the first example.)\nArguably, it is much easier to reason about the second example using %&gt;%.\nFirst, you can clearly see what data you are operating on because it's the very\nfirst word in the sequence of expressions. In the example above, this is more\ndifficult to reason about because iris is spread throughout the code. Second,\nyou can clearly identify that three functions are applied to the data. In the\nexample showing the traditional approach, you do grasp that, in the end, a mean\nis calculated, but you must read the code backwards. You must find out what is\nstored in setosa and what idx is for.\nObviously, the pipe operator is only useful if functions exist that are\ncompatible to piping. Compatibility is guaranteed by writing functions with the\nfirst argument being for data input, such as\n\nSo, why not always use piping? It makes debugging difficult. If an error occurs\nsomewhere along the pipe, traceback() won't help you a lot because its output\nwill be cluttered with %&gt;%'s internals. Thus, it makes sense to split the\npipe in reasonable sizes. This way you will be able to investigate each part of\nthe pipe on its own and trace errors more easily.\n\nTo summarize, R's pipe operator enables us to follow a philosophy that has\nproven itself to be very useful. While it encourages programmers to build\nfunctions that obey a simple principle, it opens the doors for code that is\neasier comprehensible. By doing so, it is the \"glue\" that holds together an\ninfrastructure that makes data analyses straightforward and fun: the tidyverse.\nThus, to me, it's an element of R that I never want to miss.\n4\nmagrittr also provides other interesting pipe operators such as\n%&lt;&gt;% and %$%. Take a look at the\nvignette\nto learn more about it.\n\n2\nIt's not that software development is all about problems.\nDon't get me wrong here. Actually it's a lot about creative work -- and fun!\n\n3\nBe aware that I restrict the output to the first 10 files here\nby using find.\n\n1\nThe\nWikipedia article provides\nfurther information about the philosophy and its origin.

A testing environment can be\nset up with Vagrant easily, as described in the following post.1\n\nBy default Vagrant uses virtualbox as its default\nprovider. Perhaps you would like to use a different\nprovider. In this case define your provider with the environment variable\nDEFAULT_VAGRANT_PROVIDER. E.g., on Windows it makes sense to use Hyper-V\n(hyperv) instead of VirtualBox since they do not work next to each other.\nIn the following, we configure a simple Debian host.\n\nWe then download Ansible's Vagrant Dynamic Inventory to configure Ansible hosts\nthrough the Vagrantfile listed above automatically.\n\nTo list all available machines run by Vagrant you use ./vagrant.py --list all. As you will see in the output, these machines are grouped under\n\"vagrant\".

A workaround is to use a server with a public IP\naddress as an entrance to a meshed tinc virtual private network (VPN).\n\nIn this post I describe the basic procedure to configure two Debian machines\n(one with a public IP address and one with a private IP address) to communicate\nover a tinc network. In principle, you can follow the the official configuration\nguide, however there are some aspects you must take care of\nspecifically.\nWhile the main configuration /etc/tinc/&lt;vpnname&gt;/tinc.conf can remain as it\nis, I had to put more energy into setting up the tunnel device. Check out the\nfollowing files:\n\n\nRemember to make the previous script executable with chmod +x tinc-up.\nFurther, specify the IP addresses as your network set-up requires. Ultratools\nprovides a convenient tool\nfor generating local IPv6 randomly. Remember that you are allowed to use /48\nnetworks while Ultratools generates /64 address ranges by default. Simply omit\nthe fourth block of the generated address.\n\nYou must turn on the tunnel device explicitly.\nThe subnets that each host provides must be smaller than the subnet you route\nto on the tunnel. Otherwise you would need to add routes to the foreign\nsubnets manually. See below:\n\n\nIn the next step, generate a key pair with tincd -n &lt;vpnname&gt; -K 4096 and\ninterchange all public keys between the hosts.\nAfter starting tinc on all hosts, try to ping each host in the network. For\ndebugging, you can use the following command to launch tincd directly:\n\nYou can use CTRL-C to toggle verbosity. In case you want to start tincd with\nhigher verbosity from the beginning, use the following command flag: -d5. The\nlogging information helps a lot when debugging the network setup.\nFinally, to launch tincd when booting, enable it in systemd with the\nfollowing command. Note that you need to provide the name of the tinc network,\nreplacing &lt;vpnname&gt; in the following command:\n\n","id":"https://www.niklaas.eu/tinc-for-simple-vpn/","title":"Using tinc for a simple meshed VPN network"},"https://www.niklaas.eu/unattended-upgrades/":{"body":"In some cases it makes sense to install upgrades of packages automatically.
